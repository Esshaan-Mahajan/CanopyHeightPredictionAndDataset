# CanopyHeightPredictionAndDataset

Devised and implemented a novel approach to estimate global canopy heights for the period 1980-2020 leveraging NASA GEDI 
LiDAR, meteorological datasets, Google Earth Engine, and GPUs on Pratyush HPC, fastest in India. Model was able to beat all 
previous attempts to accurately predict canopy height of a location, with an RMSE score of 2.02.

Note: A thorough description can be found out at ppt named,"Global Canopy Height and model".
